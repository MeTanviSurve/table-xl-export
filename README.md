# table-xl-export
Small library to export your simple HTML table to excel file.

I have recently started developing this library, only basic code is implemented.

How to use this library:
1. Navigate to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">/demo</span> folder and you will find <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">js/table-xl-export.js</span>
2. Include this .js file in your HTML page.
3. Use <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 600;">$("#your_table_id").exportToExcel();</span> to export your HTML table to excel file.

I am going to add new features as soon as possible to make this library worth.
