# table-xl-export
Small library to export your simple HTML table to excel file.

I have recently started developing this library, only basic code is implemented.

How to use this library:
1. Navigate to /demo folder and you wil find js/table-xl-export.js
2. Include this .js file in your HTML page.
3. Use $("#<your_table_id>")..exportToExcel(); to export your HTML table to excel file.

I am going to add new features as soon as possible to make this library worth.
